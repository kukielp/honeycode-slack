## In this session we want to demonstrate how we can connect to Slack and get any row back from the Honeycode table based off of the name. 

Create a new SLACK channel. 

To create a new channel go to http://slack.com

Create new workspace in slack, and it will ask you to enter your email address in. 

This will then send you a 6 digit authorisation code to that email address. Now we need to create a new slack workspace. 

I called my one honeycode<name>.

Click next

Whats your team working on now, type in `honeycode` and click next

Skip the next step as we are just demonstrating how to do communicate with honeycode.

Press skip step again. 

You will now have a slack workspace with channels in there called general, honeycode and random. 

We will need to capture details for this later on.
